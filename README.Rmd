# ggnormviolin <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>


The ggnormviolin package uses ggplot2 to create normal violin plots with specified means and standard deviations.

## Installation

To install the development version of ggnormviolin, you need to check
if devtools is installed. If not, run this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you are sure you have devtools installed, you can install the
development version of ggnormviolin from GitHub by running this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wjschne/ggnormviolin")
```

## Example

Suppose there are 4 hypothetically normal distributions with specific means and standard deviations. They can be plotted like so:

```{r example, dev="svg"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggnormviolin)

# Make data
d <- data.frame(
  Distribution = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
  Distribution_mean = c(80, 90, 110, 130),
  Distribution_sd = c(15, 10, 20, 5)
)

# Make Plot
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = Distribution)) +
  geom_normviolin(aes(mu = Distribution_mean, 
                      sigma = Distribution_sd), 
                  width = 0.25,
                  fill = "dodgerblue") 
```

Suppose we want to highlight the two tails of the distributions. We can add a second layer with just the tails represending the outermost 2.5% of the distributions. Set the `p_tails` to specify the total aread of the tails. Thus, if `p_tails` = 0.05, each tail will represent the outermost 2.5% of the distributions (i.e, 0.05 = 2 &mult; 0.025).


```{r example2, dev="svg"}
ggplot(data = d, aes(x = Distribution)) +
  geom_normviolin(aes(mu = Distribution_mean, 
                      sigma = Distribution_sd), 
                  width = 0.25, 
                  fill = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_normviolin(aes(mu = Distribution_mean, 
                      sigma = Distribution_sd), 
                  width = 0.25,
                  fill = "dodgerblue4",
                  p_tail = 0.05)
```
